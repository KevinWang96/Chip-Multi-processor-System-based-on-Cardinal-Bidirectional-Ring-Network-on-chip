Project Part 4
--------------------

README 
------

Steps:
1. Copy imem.v, dmem.v, gscl45nm.v in the include/ directory.

2. Copy the test bench tb_cmp.v in the tb/ directory. Testbench clock is set at 100ns.

3. Copy test_cases/ directory in your simulation directory

4. Copy makefile and runs.csh in your simulations directory 
(This makefile is slightly different than what you have been using, does not print messages)

5. Run the provided script file (./runs.csh). If the file doesn't execute, then 
   % chmod u+x runs.csh
   % ./runs.csh

   6. At the end of the execution script, it will produce two files 
   <YourUsername>.diff & <YourUsername>.log
   The .log file is the output of ncsim, while diff files gathers differences between
   the expected output and simulated output.

7. Check the log file, if you see simulation finishing at 50us, then simulation did not   finish and diff command won't produce correct output.

8. Some Info on the imem.fill files:-
   Case 0: CMP test similar to Part3 golden file.
   Case 1-18: to test a particular instruction from ISA
   Case 19-38: All instructions Random
   Case 39: All Instructions Random (special case)
